# mNeme Front End

- The deployed frontend url is https://mneme-flashcards.netlify.app/

This app is designed to help people learn with flashcards. In this release canvas, users have the ability to create a profile, edit their profile preferences, view the public demo decks, and study the public demo decks.

In future releases users will have the ability to create, edit, and delete their own decks, as well as have the option to share their decks as public, or keep them private. There will also be other study techniques incorporated like spaced repetition, which will show a card more or less frequently depending on how difficult the user rates it.
